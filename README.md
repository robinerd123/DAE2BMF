# DAE2BMF
COLLADA and texture convertor to ONE64 engine BMF model format for Nintendo 64

***Please note,***

*This tool is very unfinished and may have some bugs.*
*Many features that aren't in this public build are there but are not yet completed, so I excluded them off this release, thanks for understanding*

Oh, and P.S. the code for this is very very messy, and I didn't bother making it OO yet, but you can expect that soon.
